## Types of Environments

All environments, except Gather, are competitive team games where agents in each team must cooperate to defeat the other team. Note that reward is allocated individually.

Gather is a competitive free-for-all game where agents try to stay alive for as long as possible, either by gathering food or killing other agents.
