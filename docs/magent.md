# MAgent2

MAgent2 is a library for the creation of environments where large numbers of pixel agents in a gridworld interact in battles or other competitive scenarios. It is a maintained fork of the original [MAgent](https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent) codebase and contains some reference [environments](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/MAgent2/tree/main/magent2/environments) implemented using the [PettingZoo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo) API.
